# Forum_Webscrape
Scratching the surface on webscraping - coded a simple webscraper to scan a hardware sales forum for keywords related to products that I was interested in.

## Coding Concepts
- Use of Beautiful Soup library
- Searching parsed html for tags of interest
- Extracting URL and text information
- Writing output of search results in html format
